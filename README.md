# Reverse-Engineering
The ls Binary is simply reconstructed. There is a C++ Code:
<li>  This Binary works on Debian Linux 11 <a href=https://github.com/yusuta-gba/Reverse-Engineering/blob/main/dirent33.cpp>ls-Binary</a></li>
The mv Binary can be reconstructed, there is a paper about that:
<li>  mv & touch Binary  <a href=https://github.com/yusuta-gba/Reverse-Engineering/blob/main/Extension_PACK_Paper.pdf/>C++ and Assembly-Code</a></li>
